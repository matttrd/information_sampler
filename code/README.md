## How to print count histograms:
* python count_visualization.py --exp [the_exp_you_want_to_print]
* python organize_experiment_analysis.py --exp [the_exp_you_want_to_organize]

Now you have inside the "analysis_experiments" folder (which is inside [the_exp_you_want_to_organize]) all the experiments numbered (accordingly to date) and containing all the pdf and log you need!
